Model code is organized into structures with the following parameters:

# TRNmodel

[TRN model](TRN%20model.md) ->
This is the base TRN cell model with only external synapses

# TRNnetwork

[TRN network](TRN%20network.md) ->
TRN model with external synapses as well as GJs between TRNs

# TCnetwork

[TC network](TC%20network.md) ->
TC-TRN-CTX model with connectivity between layers and GJs between TRNs
